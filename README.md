ayudante - Helper. An accessibility plug in for websites
This tool allows a web developer to easily integrate accessibility into their website. It will allow changing of font size as well as contrast to whole pages. It creates a cookie that tracks user preferences to keep selection live until the browser is closed. It is a ver basic javascript tool and is in no way a all in one fix for meeting WCAG standards but is a good start to helping out.
